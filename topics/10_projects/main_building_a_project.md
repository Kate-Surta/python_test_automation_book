# Topic 10: Building a Test Automation Suite, utilizing both web and API testing

This project is your chance to bring together everything you’ve learned during the training. You’ll gain hands-on experience by building a Test Automation Suite that includes both Web UI and API testing. The goal is to help you apply your skills in a real-world scenario and showcase your knowledge as a Test Automation Engineer.


## Project Requirements

The project should implement a Test Automation Framework Architecture where you can develop a suite of tests with the following components:


### 1. Web UI Test Suite

Create a suite of tests for a web user interface. At least two functionalities should be included. Feel free to use any testing framework you prefer.


### 2. API Test Suite

Develop a suite of tests for an API. This should include tests for at least these API methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. You can also include tests for Data validation, and error handling. Use pytest and requests library for API testing.


### 3. Documentation

Provide basic documentation for your project, including:
- **Test Strategy**: Outline your overall approach to testing.
- **Test Plan**: Detail the specific tests to be performed, the schedule, and resources.
- **Test Cases**: Describe the individual tests in detail.
- **Test Report**: Summarize the results of the tests, including any issues found and their severity.


### 4. Optional Enhancements

Consider adding enhancements like linters and formatters to your project. These tools can help maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards and formatting rules. They can also help identify potential issues early in the development process.


## Reporting

Each suite should generate its own report, detailing the results of the tests. Additionally, there should be a global report that consolidates the results from both the Web UI and API tests.


## Deadline

The deadline for submitting the project is `13/01/2024`. This gives you ample time to plan, develop, test, and refine your Test Automation Suite. Remember, the goal is not just to complete the project, but to learn and grow as a Test Automation Engineer.


## Submission Instructions

Create your own repository on GitHub and upload all files there. Once you're done, submit the link to your repository to our Group in Teams.


## Evaluation Criteria

No measures will be applied but make sure the project is working fine and follows the requirements. Be professional.
